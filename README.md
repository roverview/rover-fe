## Overview
Even Mars Rovers need love!  Roverview is for the brave little robots that could. Just pick your favorite images from our intrepid explorers and let 'em know they are not alone. Save your favorites so you can come back and view them later. Get bored with your choices - just delete them and pick more.  

## Architecture
This is a full CRUD app with front end, back end and data base being hosted on Heroku.  The images and data are being pulled form the Nasa Mars Rover API.

## Built With
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
* [Mars Rover Photo API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos)
